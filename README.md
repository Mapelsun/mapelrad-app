## Overview

### Requirements

- Vue.js Project Setup:
  - Set up a new Vue.js project using Vue CLI or your preferred project setup method.
- Figma Screens: Here are the Figma screens that you need to replicate:
  - Login Screen
  - OTP Screen
  - Dashboard Home Screen
  - FX Screen
- Integrate APIs:
  - Head over to [maplerad sandbox environment](https://sandbox.maplerad.com), inspect the API calls being made from the frontend to determine the endpoints to use and replicate them accordingly.
- UI Replication:
- Create a user interface that closely resembles the screens from the provided Figma links.
- Pay attention to layout, fonts, colors, icons, and spacing to achieve a visually similar result.
- Link Navigation:
  - Implement basic navigation between the screens.
  - Create a menu or navigation bar that allows the user to switch between the replicated screens.
- Documentation:
- Provide clear and concise instructions on how to run your Vue.js application.

## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Bundler
- [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) - Store
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/) - For dashboard charts

### Note

**To sign out of the app**, click on the down arrow beside the user displayed avatar and full name on the dashboard header. The card wasn't implemented because it's not present in the figma interface.

### Continued development

Possible refactor at a later date and making the dashboard responsive.
